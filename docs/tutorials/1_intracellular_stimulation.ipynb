        "\n# Tutorial 1 - First steps into NRV: a simple axon\n\n## Context\n\nThe presence of the myelin sheath on large axonal fibers transforms the so-called *continuous* conduction of unmyelinated fibers into a *saltatory* conduction, largely increasing the speed of action potential propagations. In this tutorial, we will simulated several myelinated and unmyelinated fiber model using NRV and investigate how it effects the action potential propagation speed.\n\n\nFirst the nrv package is imported as well as the matplotlib package used for plotting nrv's simulation outputs.\n"
